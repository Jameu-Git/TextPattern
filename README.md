# TextPattern

TextPattern is a simple Java program that arranges a list of names into a custom 2D string pattern and prints the resulting pattern to the console. This program demonstrates the use of 2D arrays and basic string manipulation in Java.

## Features
- Dynamically initializes a 2D array with default values.
- Populates specific positions in the array with names from a predefined list.
- Prints the 2D array as a formatted pattern.

## How It Works
- A list of names is stored in a String array.
- A 10x100 2D array (pattern) is initialized with blank spaces (" ").
- Selected names from the list are assigned to specific coordinates in the 2D array.
- The resulting pattern is printed row by row to the console.
